problem if you add a multiple translation 
ie: bois;wood becomes bois;wood,log because it adds a "\n" , if you then add another translation it will
add if after the empty line, this causes the program to crash the next time you launch it

!!! only a problem if the multiple translation is on the last line of the file 
if not there is no problem it will not add an "extra line"
